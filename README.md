## Cosmological inference from Weak Lensing Mass maps with Deep Learning

Repository containing code for the inference of cosmological parameters (with uncertainty quantification) from simulated mass maps.

We use three different approaches for cosmological parameter inference:

- Standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs).
- Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) method.

All codes were run on Google Colab (Pro version, that gives better access to GPUs) GPUs, with high-RAM requirements. They can easily be adapted for use in different environments. The jupyter notebooks contain detailed descriptions of what they do, but here is a short description, to help you navigate the code:
